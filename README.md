#Hello world, this is my first application project! 

#It's a basic application for 67-272 where the user can create, edit, delete, and select students from the database.

#This was created using Bootstrap, Ruby, SQLite3 database, sinatra gem, and sqlite3 gem. 

#Have also created minimalist aesthetic via HTML/CSS!

#In the future, I hope to modify this application and add additional 
#viewing features based on major, graduation date, and maybe even 
#make the UI more convenient (e.g. @andrew.cmu.edu is automatically added when 
#a user inputs a student's andrew ID)

#Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this project - cheers.
